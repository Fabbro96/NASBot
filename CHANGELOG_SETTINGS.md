# 🎉 NASBot - Full Control Implemented

## ✅ What's been done

### 1. **Full Control via Telegram** 
Now you can configure EVERYTHING through the bot without touching the `config.json` file:

#### 🤖 **AI Summaries (Gemini 3.0 Flash)**
- Morning/evening reports with summaries generated by Gemini 3.0 Flash.
- Simple configuration: just enter your `gemini_api_key` in `config.json`.
- Get your free API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
- Fallback to standard report if the key is missing or invalid.
- Respects the configured language (English/Italian).

#### 📨 **Daily Reports**
- Choose between: Disabled / Once daily / Twice daily.
- Schedules remain as configured in `config.json` (morning/evening).

#### 🌙 **Quiet Hours**
- Enable/Disable quiet hours.
- No notifications during this period.
- Schedules are currently configured in `config.json`.

#### 🧹 **Docker Prune (Automatic Cleanup)**
- Enable/Disable automatic cleanup.
- Choose the day of the week (Monday - Sunday).
- Fixed time (currently configured in `config.json`).

#### 🌐 **Language**
- Switch between English and Italian.
- All interfaces update immediately.

### 2. **Full Persistence**
All settings are saved in `nasbot_state.json` and restored when the bot restarts.

### 3. **Complete Settings Menu**
Access `/settings` for:
```
⚙️ Settings

🌐 Language: English 🇬🇧
📨 Daily Reports: Twice daily
🌙 Quiet Hours: 23:30 - 07:00
🧹 Docker Prune: Sunday 04:00
```

### 4. **Fixed Indentation**
All code has been formatted with `gofmt` for perfect and consistent indentation.
