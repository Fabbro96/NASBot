# Contributing to NASBot

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.

When creating a bug report, include:
- **Clear title** describing the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** the behavior
- **Expected behavior** vs what actually happened
- **System info**: OS, Go version, Docker version (if applicable)
- **Logs** (run with `./nasbot 2>&1 | tee nasbot.log`)

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Please:
- Check if the feature was already requested
- Describe the use case clearly
- Explain why this would benefit other users

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Ensure local hooks are enabled (required): `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
3. Ensure the code compiles: `go build ./...`
4. Run tests: `go test ./...`
5. If relevant, validate release build: `./scripts/build_release.sh`
6. Update docs if you added new features/commands
7. Submit your PR with a clear description

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nasbot.git
cd nasbot

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Enable hardening hooks (required)
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit scripts/secret_scan.sh

# Create config
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your bot token and user ID

# Build
go build -o nasbot .

# Run
./nasbot
```

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment exported functions and complex logic
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized

## Security Rules (Required)

- Do not commit real secrets in any file.
- Keep credentials only in local `config.json` (gitignored).
- Use `config.example.json` for templates and examples.
- Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before release/tag.

## Adding New Commands

1. Add the command to `handleCommand()` switch statement
2. Create a function `getXxxText()` for text generation or `handleXxx()` for actions
3. Update `getHelpText()` to document the new command
4. Update README.md with the new command
